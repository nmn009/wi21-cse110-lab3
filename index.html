        <h2>Struggles:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Language</strong>: One of the biggest struggles in my life is studying other language.
            However, I am happy because I made it. Also, if I can't learn other language, I could I learn Java or C????</li>
          <li><strong>Financial</strong>: Of course, everyone has this problem because of COVID19. However, we have a lot of helps from government. I am happy that
            I'm living here.<li>
          <li><strong>School</strong>: Coding seems very interesting but to do it is hard.I remember first time writing <code>System.out.println("Hello, world!")</code>, I was 
            very excited to see how it print Hello, world to the console. I know it is just a simplest code and there are a lot difficult out there but I still keep trying and trying.

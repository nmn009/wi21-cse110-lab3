      <h2>Introduction:</h2>
      <p>My name is <span class="ingredient">Nhat Nguyen</span>. I am from <b>VietNam</b>. I have been here in the US for more than <i>5 years</i> now.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>First time come here, I am very sad because I have to start a new life while I get used to the old life. I'm not ready for the new life yet.
        However, after spend years and years in the US, I am very happy because of my decision to come here. I have more friends and start to do what I like now.

      <h2>Hobbies:</h2>
      <p>What I do like in free time is <strong> playing video game</strong> and <strong>working out</strong> with my friends.</p>
      <p>Other than that, I also spend night time to read <em>some books</em> and <em>coding</em></p>
      <p>I am happy because of taking CSE class because the more I learn the more I know how we bring these coding to real life.</p>

        <h2>Struggles:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Language</strong>: One of the biggest struggles in my life is studying other language.
            However, I am happy because I made it. Also, if I can't learn other language, I could I learn Java or C????</li>
          <li><strong>Financial</strong>: Of course, everyone has this problem because of COVID19. However, we have a lot of helps from government. I am happy that
            I'm living here.<li>
          <li><strong>School</strong>: Coding seems very interesting but to do it is hard.I remember first time writing <code>System.out.println("Hello, world!")</code>, I was 
            very excited to see how it print Hello, world to the console. I know it is just a simplest code and there are a lot difficult out there but I still keep trying and trying.
